This project provides a robust web scraper for YellowPages.com using Puppeteer with the Stealth plugin to avoid detection and gather business information based on phone numbers.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Uses Puppeteer Stealth plugin to avoid bot detection
- **Phone Number Processing**: Reads phone numbers from CSV and processes them
- **Human-like Behavior**: Implements scrolling, mouse movements, and random delays
- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Extracts structured and unstructured data from business pages

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for failed requests and missing data

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- NPM (comes with Node.js)
- A CSV file with phone numbers (currently configured for `10.csv` in the Yelp_Lookup folder)

## Installation

1. **Enable PowerShell execution** (if needed):
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   npm run connectivity-test
   ```

3. **Quick functionality test**:
   ```bash
   npm run quick-test
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Scraper

Run the basic scraper:
```bash
node scraper.js
```

Or use the npm script:
```bash
npm start
```

### Enhanced Scraper

Run the enhanced scraper (recommended):
```bash
node enhanced_scraper.js
```

## Configuration

### File Paths
- **Input CSV**: `C:/Users/clint/Desktop/Geocoding_Task/Yelp_Lookup/10.csv`
- **Output CSV**: `yellowpages_scraped_data.csv` (basic) or `yellowpages_enhanced_scraped_data.csv` (enhanced)

### Settings
You can modify the configuration in the scripts:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    csvFilePath: 'C:/Users/clint/Desktop/Geocoding_Task/Yelp_Lookup/10.csv',
    outputFilePath: 'yellowpages_enhanced_scraped_data.csv',
    phoneNumbersToProcess: 5,  // Number of phone numbers to process
    delays: {
        betweenRequests: 3000,  // Delay between phone number searches
        pageLoad: 2000,         // Wait time after page load
        humanLike: { min: 1000, max: 3000 }  // Random delay range
    }
};
```

## How It Works

1. **Phone Number Extraction**: 
   - Reads the CSV file and extracts unique phone numbers from the `phone` column
   - Randomly selects 5 phone numbers for processing

2. **Phone Number Formatting**:
   - Converts phone numbers from format `425-673-3675` to `425+673+3675`
   - Constructs search URLs: `https://www.yellowpages.com/search?search_terms=425+673+3675`

3. **Search Results Processing**:
   - Navigates to each search URL
   - Extracts business links from the search results
   - Finds links in `div.scrollable-pane > div.search-results.organic` container

4. **Business Data Extraction**:
   - Visits each business page
   - Extracts comprehensive information including:
     - Basic details (name, phone, address, website)
     - Business information sections
     - JSON-LD structured data
     - Categories and ratings
     - Metadata and additional fields

5. **Data Export**:
   - Saves all extracted data to CSV
   - Dynamically creates columns for all found fields
   - Maintains data integrity with proper escaping

## Browser Settings

The scraper uses the following browser settings for stealth:

- Viewport settings (1366x768)
- Various anti-detection measures

## Error Handling

The scraper includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network timeouts
- Missing page elements
- Invalid phone numbers
- Parsing errors
- Browser crashes

## Output

The scraper generates CSV files with all extracted data. The CSV structure is dynamic and adapts to include all fields found during scraping.

Example output columns:
- `ORIGINAL_PHONE`
- `SEARCH_URL`
- `BUSINESS_URL`
- `BUSINESS_NAME`
- `ADDRESS`
- `WEBSITE`
- `CATEGORIES`
- `JSONLD_LATITUDE`
- `JSONLD_LONGITUDE`
- And many more...

## Notes

- The scraper runs in non-headless mode by default for debugging. Set `headless: true` for production use.
- Random delays are implemented to avoid being blocked
- The scraper respects robots.txt and implements reasonable delays
- All data is sanitized before CSV export

## Troubleshooting

1. **Browser won't start**: Make sure you have Chrome/Chromium installed
2. **CSV file not found**: Check the file path in the configuration
3. **No data extracted**: The website structure may have changed
4. **Memory issues**: Reduce the number of phone numbers to process
